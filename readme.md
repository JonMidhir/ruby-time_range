## About

`TimeRange` extends the regular `Range` with useful methods that apply to time-based objects. Where appropriate, it reimplements `Range` methods as they should apply to Time-based ranges.

`TimeRange`s can be compared and examined in useful ways.

- `TimeRange#duration` The duration of the TimeRange in seconds.
- `TimeRange#encapsulates?` Check if one TimeRange encapsulates another entirely.
- `TimeRange#encapsulated_by?` Check if one TimeRange is encapsulated by another entirely...
- `TimeRange#overlaps?` Check if one TimeRange overlaps another in any way.
- `TimeRange#overlap_with` Returns the overlap between two TimeRanges, as a new TimeRange.
- `TimeRange#dates` Returns a range of dates in the TimeRange.

Existing Range methods; such as `#max`, `#min`, `#cover?`, `#==`, etc, are still available, having been reimplemented where appropriate to maintain consistency in a temporal context.

TimeRanges can be easily created by calling `#to_time_range` on any normal Range of Times.

```ruby
  (Time.now .. (Time.now + 60)).to_time_range
```
